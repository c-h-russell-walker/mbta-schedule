# MBTA-Schedule Web Application
React App for displaying realtime MBTA schedules.

Current requirements:

A web application that shows live Commuter Rail departure board:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The application should show the upcoming departures at North and South stations

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- the train destinations

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- the departure times

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- the track numbers

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- the boarding status (e.g. 'Boarding', 'All Aboard', 'Delayed')

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
